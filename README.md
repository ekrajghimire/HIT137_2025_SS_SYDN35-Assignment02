Software Now - Assignment 2

## Overview
This repository contains the assignment task for HIT137 Group Assignment 02.
The assignment focuses on file handling, encryption/decryption, data analysis, recursion, and visualization using Python.
All tasks were developed collaboratively and tracked using GitHub as per the assignment requirements.

## Question 1
Create a program that reads the text file "raw_text.txt", encrypts its contents using a simple encryption method, and writes the encrypted text to a new file "encrypted_text.txt". Then create a function to decrypt the content and a function to verify the decryption was successful.
*Requirements*
The encryption should take two user inputs (shift1, shift2), and follow these rules:
  • For lowercase letters:
    o If the letter is in the first half of the alphabet (a-m): shift forward by shift1 * shift2 positions
    o If the letter is in the second half (n-z): shift backward by shift1 + shift2 positions
  • For uppercase letters:
    o If the letter is in the first half (A-M): shift backward by shift1 positions
    o If the letter is in the second half (N-Z): shift forward by shift2² positions (shift2 squared)
  • Other characters:
    o Spaces, tabs, newlines, special characters, and numbers remain unchanged
*Main Functions to Implement*
**Encryption function:** Reads from "raw_text.txt" and writes encrypted content to "encrypted_text.txt".
**Decryption function:** Reads from "encrypted_text.txt" and writes the decrypted content to "decrypted_text.txt".
**Verification function:** Compares "raw_text.txt" with "decrypted_text.txt" and prints whether the decryption was successful or not.
*Program Behavior*
When run, your program should automatically:
  1. Prompt the user for shift1 and shift2 values
  2. Encrypt the contents of "raw_text.txt"
  3. Decrypt the encrypted file
  4. Verify the decryption matches the original
